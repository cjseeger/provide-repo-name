**_A Cold Day*_*

It's Cold! Today.

It's a cold day in January.
The January rises like a big winter.
Why does the blizzard freeze?

Where is the frozen arctic?
It's moved into my attic.
So cold, that diamonds freeze?

Endurance, hate, and cold.
The icy girl screaming, views the coat.
January please melt!
